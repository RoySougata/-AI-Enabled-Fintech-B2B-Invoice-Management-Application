# AI Enabled Fintech B2B Invoice Management Application

Designed a Machine Learning model to predict the bill clear date i.e., the date by which a customer will clear the bill amount.
o	The past bill payment data was analyzed to predict the date by which the customer may clear the bill of the new invoices.
o	The customers who usually delayed the payment or in other words for whom the predicted bill clear date was later than the bill due date, were put in different delinquency buckets of 30 days, 60days and more than 60 days.
o	This information of bucketing the customers was helpful for the payment collection team as now the team had the information on which customers are more likely to miss the payment due date and may delay the actual payment by how many days based on the delinquency bucket the customer is present in.
o	The above information helped the payment collection team to prioritize the customers and follow up with the delinquent customers accordingly.
